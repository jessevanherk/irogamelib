Poisson Disk Sampling.
Based on code and algorithm from:
http://devmag.org.za/2009/05/03/poisson-disk-sampling/

num_tries = 1 : will probably only ever return then starting point.
num_tries <= 6: will likely stop and only return a small set of samples
num_tries = 10: will provide nice dispersed "organic" looking samples
num_tries = 20: fairly dense but with some empty pockets.
num_tries = 30: will provide nice dense cluster of points
num_tries > 30: doesn't really add much, other than slowing things down.

Before a newly generated point is admitted as a sample point, we have to
check that no previously generated points are too close.  Because of the
radius chosen, we need to check a 5x5 section of the grid, centered on our
point.
We don't actually need to check the 4 corner cells, but it simplifies
the algorithm to check all 25 cells.
